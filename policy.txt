ShareGuard
Effective Date: 2025-10-16

ShareGuard values your privacy. This privacy policy explains how your data is handled when you use our app. Spoiler: we don’t collect it. Here's what that really means.

1. No Data Collection
ShareGuard does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
Everything happens locally on your device. That means:

 * No user accounts
 * No analytics or tracking
 * No cloud uploads
 * No third-party integrations
 * No data sharing with us or others

Your photos, edits, and exports stay on your device — unless you shared them to others.

2. Offline Processing
All features in ShareGuard run entirely offline. We never upload your files to any server.

3. Local Storage Only
Your data is only saved:

* Temporarily in memory while using the app
* We don’t have access to these files, and they’re never shared unless you do it yourself.

4. No Third-Party SDKs
We do not use advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, or any third-party services. No tracking. No fingerprinting. No hidden surprises.

5. Your Rights
Since we don’t collect any data, there’s nothing for you to request, delete, or revoke.
But if you have questions or concerns, we’re happy to answer them.

6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the effective date at the top of this policy. Continued use of ShareGuard after any modifications signifies acceptance of these changes.

7. Contact Information
